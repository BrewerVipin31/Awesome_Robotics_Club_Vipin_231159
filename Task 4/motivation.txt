I chose 2 projects from robotics club : AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION OF MARS ROVER, SPACE STATION: CONTROLS & COMMUNICATION. I have a huge interest in the field of robotics and machines.

I chose Mars rover and Space station projects because the project teaches many new fields of technology like machine learning, deep learning, control theory and many more which I am yet to explore. Also our country who is booming in the space sector, projects like these can be of huge benefits for our country and its people. 

Hope to see us working together on the projectsðŸ¤ž
