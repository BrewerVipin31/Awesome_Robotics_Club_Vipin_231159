How the code works:

1. Read Input Image: The code reads an image named "image2.png" using OpenCV's `cv2.imread` function and stores it in the variable `input_image`.

2. Thresholding: It iterates over the rows and columns of the image, calculating the average pixel value for each row and column. If the average pixel value is below a certain threshold (`black_threshold`), it marks the entire row or column as black by setting all its pixels to [0, 0, 0] (black).

3. Finding X and Y Coordinates: After thresholding, the code finds the X and Y coordinates of the regions marked as black. These coordinates will be used later to divide the image into smaller regions.

4. Dividing the Image: The code divides the image into smaller regions based on the X and Y coordinates found earlier. For each region, it calculates the average pixel value and determines if the region should be marked as blue (`[255, 0, 0]`) or yellow (`[0, 255, 255]`) based on a threshold (`blue_threshold`).

5. Path Finding: It then performs a path-finding algorithm to find a path from the bottom-right corner of the image to the top-left corner, avoiding regions marked as blue. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to achieve this.

6. Marking the Path: Once the path is found, the code marks the pixels along the path as red (`[0, 0, 255]`) to highlight the path.

7. Displaying the Image: Finally, it converts the image from BGR to RGB format using `cv2.split` and `cv2.merge` and displays the final image using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`.
